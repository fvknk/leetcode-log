# 1661. Average Time of Process per Machine

## Intuition

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```sql
SELECT
  a1.machine_id,
  ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2
  ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
  AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
  AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
  AND a1.activity_type != a2.activity_type
GROUP BY a1.machine_id
;
```
